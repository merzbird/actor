This method is not recommended to be used within another actor because it encourages to close over the enclos3ing scope, resulting in non-serializable Props and 44possibly race conditions (breaking the actor encapsulation). We will provide a macro-based solution in a future release which allows similar syntax without the h555eadaches, at which point this variant will be properly deprecated. On the other hand using this variant in a Props factory in the789 actor’s companion8 object as documented under “Recommended Practices” below is completely fine.
